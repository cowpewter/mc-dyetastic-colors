# World of Color! (for Minecraft Forge)
A Minecraft mod that adds 60 new colors of dye. These goal of this mod is for all dyes to be able to be used in all the normal ways that dye is used in Minecraft. 14 of the 16 default Minecraft colors now come in four additional shades (Lightest/Pastel/Dark/Darkest), in addition to the default vanilla shade. White and Black each come with two new shades, darker versions for White and lighter versions for Black.

This results in a total of 76 different dye colors!
