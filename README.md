## FAQ

> What modloaders is this mod available for?
>> Currently, only Forge. I want to fully expand this mod for Forge before I even consider Fabric

> What Minecraft versions is this mod available for?
>> Currently, 1.16.5. I want to wait and see if 1.18 becomes the new popular modding platform after it comes out before I start porting it to other versions.
